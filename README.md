<h1>Two Sum Coding Exercise</h1>

Given a sorted array of integers in non-decreasing order, you need to find two numbers in the array that add up to a specific target. The indices of these two numbers, denoted as index1 and index2, should be returned in a 1-indexed array [index1, index2].

Here's an example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 is 1, and index2 is 2. The function returns [1, 2].

Constraints:

The array "numbers" has at least two elements and at most 30,000 elements.
Each element in "numbers" is between -1000 and 1000.
The array "numbers" is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The target value is between -1000 and 1000.
There is exactly one solution for each test case.
